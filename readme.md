# Timetable Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome Extension made with Vue to give students a Timetable class application in their browser.

An customizable  **JSON** file allows teachers and/or students to easily upload and use their own class schedule for their own school.

Features
- See your next classes and which classroom is up next.
-  Alerts you 5/10/20 minutes before the current class is dismissed.

Node.js and Vue has to be installed for this to run. *Go to their respective websites for installation instructions*.

### To get started, clone this repository, cd into it and run
```
$ npm install
```
and
```
$ npm run build:dev
```

When everything us up and running you simply enable developer mode on the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page and load the unpacked folder.

Once you have loaded the extension pack, vue-web-extension allows you to keep watching for new changes and hot reload the extension. To make use of this, you simply need to run
```
$ npm run watch:dev
```
ðŸ“š The extension should now be ready for testing and development ðŸŽ‰
